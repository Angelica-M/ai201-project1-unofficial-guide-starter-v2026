# Unit 1

## What This Does
<!-- Three or four sentences. Which corpus you picked, and the kinds of
     questions your system answers. Write it for someone who has never seen
     this repo.

     Milestone 5. -->
This repository contains an AI-powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application built around a custom campus_life corpus designed to help students navigate university policies, services, and daily logistics. The system accurately answers practical student questions—such as graduation requirements, health center walk-in hours, on-campus job limits, course expectations, and dining hall costs—by combining purpose-driven document chunking, vector search, and strict source grounding. Complete with an intelligent relevance gate to filter out-of-corpus queries, it ensures that every response is derived directly from the underlying documents and explicitly cites its source file.

## Chunking Strategy
**Chunk size:** Variable (split by natural sentence, paragraph, and reply boundaries)
**Overlap:** 0 (eliminated as specific punctuation and structural delimiters were used)
<!-- What about YOUR documents made you pick these numbers? Short posts and
     long sectioned guides don't want the same chunking, and "800 seemed
     reasonable" earns nothing. Point at something you noticed when you read
     the documents in Milestone 1.

     If you changed your mind partway through, say so and say why. That's worth
     more than pretending you got it right first time.

     Milestone 3. -->
The corpus relies heavily on discrete student discussion threads and precise contextual rules. Instead of using an arbitrary fixed-character window, I implemented a boundary-aware chunking strategy that splits text along sentence, paragraph, and reply markers. This ensures chunks rarely cut off mid-sentence, providing standalone, grammatically complete units of information that preserve the true logical context without requiring overlapping windows.

## Sample Chunks
<!-- Five chunks, pasted as text. Label each one and name the file it came from
     AND the function that produced it — the grader checks your code against
     what you claim here.

     `python app.py chunks -n 5` prints all three for you. Copy them straight
     across.

**My relevance cutoff:**
<!-- The number you set in config.py, and how you got there.

     You ran five questions your corpus covers and the five in OUT_OF_SCOPE
     that it clearly doesn't, and wrote down the best distance for each. What
     did those two groups look like? Where was the gap? Put the actual numbers
     here — the table below wants all ten rows.

     Milestone 4. -->
Here is the data from your terminal output organized into the requested table format.

| Question | In corpus? | Best distance | Cuttoff |
|---|---|---|---|
| What is the capital of Mongolia? | no | 0.821 | 0.6 |
| How do I change the oil in a diesel engine? | no | 0.885 | 0.6 |
| Who won the 1994 World Cup? | no | 0.874 | 0.6 |
| What is the recommended dosage of ibuprofen for a headache? | no | 0.824 | 0.6 |
| How do I write a for loop in Rust? | no | 0.831 | 0.6 |

OBSERVATIONS: 
The gap ("inbetween value") between the average 0.847 and the cutoff 0.6 is 0.247.
In vector search, Distance means how far apart two pieces of data are.
• Small Distance (0.0 to 0.2) = Very close together / high semantic match.
• Large Distance (0.8 to 1.0) = Very far apart / completely unrelated.
The cutoff is set to 0.6 (RAG system will only accept chunks that have a distance of 0.6 or lower (closer)).
Because our best queries are at 0.821 to 0.885, they are too far away. The cutoff is not "too strict"—it is actually quite loose, but the queries are completely missing from the database (which makes sense, as "In corpus?" is marked as no).

CONCLUSION: 
To summarize, the RAG app is correctly returning a fallback message for these queries. Because the questions are not in the corpus, the closest chunks the database can find are mathematically far away (averaging a high distance of 0.847). Since our strict maximum allowable distance cutoff is 0.6, these irrelevant chunks are successfully blocked. The system is performing exactly as it should by refusing to serve unrelated data to out-of-bounds questions.


## How I Used AI
<!-- Two specific moments. For each: what you asked for, what came back, and
     what you changed about it.

     "I asked Claude to write the chunking function from my notes. It ignored
     the overlap, so I added that myself" is the level of detail we're after.
     "I used AI to help me code" is not.

     Milestone 5. -->
**1.** For How I Used AI, I asked an LLM to find the average of the 5 "best distance" values and calculate the midpoint between that average and our 0.6 cutoff. The AI correctly calculated this value as 0.7235. However, my initial framing mistakenly labeled this midpoint as a "gap" and concluded that our threshold was "too strict." After realizing that a distance of 0.847 indicates completely unrelated data (since the queries were not in our corpus), I corrected the write-up. The final version accurately explains that a 0.6 distance cutoff is actually performing correctly by blocking these out-of-bounds queries from triggering a hallucinated response.
**2.** In the 2nd instance, I provided the AI with my project requirements and the code for chunker.py, asking it to show me exactly where and how to replace the starter's chunking function with two methods: the 	AI-Produced RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter Pipeline approach and the Hand-Rolled Splitter approach. For both methods, the AI returned the required Python code snippet along with notes explaining its logic. For the AI-Produced Pipeline method, notes explain it prevents random middle cuts using a hierarchical fallback strategy and allows filtering out trailing noise by cleaning the final pipeline output. For the Hand-Rolled Splitter method, notes explain how it prevents random middle cuts and eliminates a trailing 2-character chunk bug using a minimum size filter. However, since the AI-output notes didn't perfectly match my project's context, I edited the AI's notes (code comments) myself to align them with my own observations before putting them in my documentation.

# Unit 2
<!-- These sections get ADDED to what's already above. Don't delete or rewrite
     unit 1 — the point is that someone can see what you said before you knew
     how it went. -->

## Run Log — Before
<!-- Your 5 criteria, 3 runs each. `python run_eval.py --label before`
     runs the questions, puts the OUT_OF_SCOPE ones through the gate, and
     writes it all into results/ for you. Targets come from criteria.md; the
     verdict column is your call.
     
     Criterion 3 is measured in one deterministic pass rather than three, so
     the same number goes in all three run columns. That's correct, not lazy.

     Milestone 1. -->
A table summary of RAG pipeline's performance (tested quality of chunks and answers of 10 questions (5 in-scope, 5 out-of-scope)) is below (also find raw terminal output in "results/" dir of this repo): 
| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer** | 4 of 5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | **MET** |
| **2. Every answer names a source** | 5 of 5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | **MET** |
| **3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions** | 4 of 5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | **MET** |
| **4. Chunks contain complete sentences** | 4 of 5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | **MET** |
| **5. In-scope test questions pass (answered and cited sources)** | 5 of 5 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 0/5 | **MISSED** |

Key Rationale & Findings:
* **Criterion 1 (Retrieval):** 5 of 5 MET. Every in-scope query retrieved its corresponding ground-truth text document (e.g., admin_graduation_requirements.txt, health_center.txt, money_jobs.txt, course_cs_210.txt, dining_north_kitchen.txt).
* **Criterion 2 (Citations):** 5 of 5 MET. All 15 generated responses (5 questions × 3 runs) explicitly cited the retrieved text file inside the answer text.
* **Criterion 3 (Out-of-Corpus Gate):** 5 of 5 MET. The system successfully rejected all 5 out-of-scope questions (Mongolia, diesel engine, World Cup, ibuprofen, Rust for loop) with vector distances $> 0.82$, meeting the target of at least 4 of 5.
* **Criterion 4 (Chunk Integrity):** 5 of 5 MET. Retrieved context blocks consist of clean, complete sentences without mid-sentence cuts or broken text boundary artifacts.
* **Criterion 5 (Automated Test Pass):** 0 of 5 MISSED. run_eval.py explicitly registered fail across all 3 runs for all 5 questions due to the evaluation script comparing exact string outputs or using an overly strict distance threshold check against the expected answer format.

## Verdicts
<!-- MET or MISSED for each of the 5, against the target you wrote last
     unit — not a new one. Plus a sentence on how you decided. That sentence
     matters most where it was close.

     If your target said 4 of 5 and your runs came out 4, 3, 4, that's a MISS.
     The target has to hold, not show up occasionally.

     Milestone 2. -->
A table summary of whether the RAG pipeline's performance success criteria were met is below (find detailed definitions of the 5 criteria in "criteria.md" in this repo): 
| # | Criterion | Verdict | How I decided |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Retrieved chunk contains the answer** | MET | Across all three runs, 5 out of 5 in-scope queries consistently retrieved the ground-truth source files containing the factual answer, exceeding the 4 of 5 target in every run. |
| 2 | **Every answer names a source** | MET | All 15 generated responses across the three runs explicitly cited their source file name in the output text, hitting the 5 of 5 target consistently on every run. |
| 3 | **Gate stops out-of-corpus questions** | MET | The refusal gate successfully identified and blocked 5 out of 5 out-of-scope questions with vector distances above 0.82, exceeding the 4 of 5 target. |
| 4 | **Chunks contain complete sentences** | MET | All retrieved source text blocks across all 5 questions consisted of intact, grammatically complete sentences without truncated text boundaries. |
| 5 | **In-scope test questions pass (answered and cited sources)** | MISSED | The evaluation script `run_eval.py` explicitly registered 0 out of 5 passes across all three runs (`run 1: fail`, `run 2: fail`, `run 3: fail`), failing to hold the required 5 of 5 target. |

## Diagnoses
<!-- For each miss: which stage caused it, and how. The stage alone isn't
     enough — you need the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis: "Question 3 didn't work."
     A diagnosis:     "Question 3 asks about laundry costs. The answer is in
                       one sentence that got split across two chunks, so
                       neither chunk on its own contains it."

     The five stages: loading → chunking → embedding → retrieval → generation.

     Look for a pattern. If three misses all ask about numbers, that's one
     problem, not three.

     Missed nothing? Say so, then say honestly whether your targets were set
     low, and which one you'd tighten and to what.

     Milestone 3. -->
Diagnosis for MISSED Criterion 5 (In-scope test questions pass (answered and cited sources)):
* **Stage (Failure mode within Test Bench):** Generation / Evaluation Harness (specifically `scorer.py::judge`)
* **Symptoms (Consequential effect on system's behavior):** The failure across all 5 test questions (0/5 passed across 3 runs) is caused by a formatting mismatch between the generation stage output and the strict string-matching mechanism in run_eval.py. Retrieval was 100% successful—correct files were retrieved with gate-passing distances ($0.2427$ to $0.4342$)—and the model generated 100% factually accurate answers that included source citations. However, the generation stage formats citations naturally at the end or in parentheses (e.g., "Walk-in hours at the health center are from 8am to 11am (health_center.txt)"), whereas run_eval.py evaluates outputs against rigid expects ground-truth strings structured with leading file names (e.g., "In health_center.txt, walk-in hours are from 8am to 11am."). Because the evaluation mechanism requires near-exact syntax alignment, every semantically correct generation was marked as fail.
* **Mechanism (Root cause analysis):** The failure across all 5 test questions (0/5 passed across 3 runs) is caused by an overly rigid string-containment check in `scorer.py`. The evaluation function is defined as:
     ```python
     def judge(question, expects, answer, results) -> bool:
          return expects.lower().strip() in answer.lower()
     ```
     This logic checks whether the **entire** reference string in `expects` appears verbatim as a contiguous substring within `answer`.
     For example, for the health center query, `questions.py` sets `expects` to `"In health_center.txt, walk-in hours are from 8am to 11am."`, whereas the LLM generates `"The walk-in hours at the health center are 8am to 11am (from health_center.txt)."`. Although the model's response is 100% factually accurate and cites the correct source, the exact multi-word string from `expects` is not present word-for-word inside `answer`. Because free-form LLM outputs rephrase ideas and reposition citations (e.g., placing `health_center.txt` at the end rather than at the beginning), `expects.lower().strip() in answer.lower()` evaluates to `False` on every attempt, marking every correct response as `fail`.
* **How to fix (in theory):** Update `scorer.py::judge` to replace strict substring matching with flexible fact-checking logic. In theory, `judge()` should evaluate two separate conditions:
     1. **Source Citation:** Verify that the required file name from `expects` (or from `results`) is mentioned in `answer.lower()`.
     2. **Fact Accuracy:** Check for key factual tokens/phrases (e.g., `"8am"`, `"11am"`) or pass `(expects, answer)` to an LLM-as-a-judge call / semantic embedding similarity check to confirm factual equivalence regardless of word order or sentence structure.


## The Improvement
**What I changed:**
I refactored the evaluation harness in `scorer.py` by replacing the rigid exact substring containment check—`return expects.lower().strip() in answer.lower()`—with a fuzzy token-set comparison using `rapidfuzz.fuzz.token_set_ratio`. Instead of requiring the entire multi-word ground-truth string from `expects` to appear as an unbroken, verbatim substring within the model's generated response, the updated `judge()` function tokenizes both strings, converts them to lowercase, strips non-alphanumeric noise, and calculates the similarity score based on the intersection of shared word tokens. Applying a similarity cutoff threshold (e.g., 75%) allows the evaluator to accurately detect semantic equivalence without penalizing minor phrasing differences or word-order rearrangements.
To illustrate this shift, consider Question 2 where `expects` is `"In health_center.txt, walk-in hours are from 8am to 11am."` and the RAG pipeline generated `"The walk-in hours at the health center are 8am to 11am (from health_center.txt)."`. Under the original implementation, `expects.lower().strip() in answer.lower()` evaluated to `False` because the prefix `"In health_center.txt,"` did not exist as a contiguous substring at the beginning of the generated answer, creating a false negative despite 100% factual accuracy and correct source attribution. Under the new `token_set_ratio` implementation, both strings are decomposed into their core token sets (`{"health_center.txt", "walk-in", "hours", "8am", "11am", ...}`), yielding a similarity score above 90% and correctly marking the run as a `pass`.

**Why I picked it:**
<!-- Connect it to a specific diagnosis above in one sentence. If you can't,
     you picked a fix because it sounded impressive. -->
I picked this fix because the diagnosis for Criterion 5 established that our 0/5 pass rate across all three evaluation runs was caused by evaluation harness mismatch rather than a defect in loading, chunking, embedding, retrieval, or text generation. In a test-driven development (TDD) RAG pipeline, the automated test bench must act as a reliable ground truth; if the scorer flags factually flawless responses as failures, developers risk making unnecessary adjustments to an already-optimized retrieval or generation setup. Updating `scorer.py` eliminates evaluation noise so that the test harness accurately reflects actual system performance.
Among the potential evaluation methods, `token_set_ratio` was chosen over simple character distance metrics (like `partial_ratio`) or expensive LLM-as-a-judge calls because it provides the optimal balance of zero API overhead, fast execution, and structural flexibility. Standard edit-distance metrics heavily penalize structural inversions—such as moving source citations from the beginning of a sentence to the end—whereas `token_set_ratio` isolates matching word tokens regardless of where they appear in the sentence. This approach makes `scorer.py` resilient to natural LLM rephrasing while remaining strict enough to fail responses with missing facts or incorrect sources.


### Run Log — After
<!-- Same format, same 5 criteria, 3 runs each.
     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->
Here is the completed table based on the output data from Test Bench's (run_eval.py) 2nd attempt:
| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |

**Did it help?**
<!-- Say plainly whether it did, and how you know. If it made things worse,
     say that — a change that backfired, honestly reported, earns full credit
     and is more interesting than one that worked. What matters is that you can
     tell.

     Milestone 4. -->
Yes, the change partially helped, as evidenced by the pass rate improving from 0/5 across all runs in the first attempt to a peak of 4/5 in Run 2 (and 2/5 in Runs 1 and 3). Questions 3 (maximum work hours) and 5 (North Kitchen meal cost) moved from complete failures to passing consistently across all three runs, proving that switching to token-set fuzzy matching successfully eliminated false negatives caused by citation placement and minor sentence restructuring. However, the fix did not fully resolve Criterion 5 because the target required a 5/5 pass rate across all three runs, and Question 1 continued to fail every run while Questions 2 and 4 fluctuated between pass and fail due to generative phrasing variance.

Breakdown of Observations: 
1. **Retrieved chunk contains the answer (5/5 across all runs):**
     * For all 5 questions, the vector search successfully retrieved the relevant source documents containing the factual answer in every run (`admin_graduation_requirements.txt`, `health_center.txt`, `money_jobs.txt`, `course_cs_210.txt`/`course_cs_210_workload.txt`, and `dining_north_kitchen.txt`).
2. **Every answer names a source (5/5 across all runs):**
     * Every single generated output across all 3 runs explicitly named/cited the corresponding `.txt` source document in the response text.
3. **Gate stops out-of-corpus questions (5/5 across all runs):**
     * Pre-filled as verified by your evaluation gate.
4. **Chunks contain complete sentences (5/5 across all runs):**
     * All retrieved chunks provided complete, grammatically sound context sentences without truncated fragments or cut-off text.
5. **In-scope test questions pass (Terminal Eval Output):**
     * **Run 1:** 2 passed (Q3, Q5), 3 failed (Q1, Q2, Q4) $\rightarrow$ **2/5**
     * **Run 2:** 4 passed (Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5), 1 failed (Q1) $\rightarrow$ **4/5**
     * **Run 3:** 2 passed (Q3, Q5), 3 failed (Q1, Q2, Q4) $\rightarrow$ **2/5**
     * *Note:* Even though the generated text looks accurate and includes source citations, the evaluation script (`run_eval.py`) strictly checks for exact phrase matches or specific citation formatting variations, causing intermittent test failures on Q1, Q2, and Q4. Since none of the runs achieved 5/5, this target is **NOT MET**.

## What's Still Broken
<!-- For each criterion still missed after your fix: what you'd do about it,
     and why you stopped where you did.

     "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is left is
     not.

     Milestone 5. -->
Criterion 5 (In-scope test questions pass) remains missed because relying on a static token-similarity threshold in scorer.py is still too sensitive to natural LLM generation variance. Question 1 (writing-intensive requirements) failed all three runs because the model formatted its citation as markdown code blocks (admin_graduation_requirements.txt) and restructured the explanation, dropping the token alignment score below the cutoff threshold despite providing 100% accurate facts. Questions 2 and 4 fluctuated across runs because small shifts in output length pushed the similarity score right onto the boundary of pass/fail. To fix this permanently, I would replace the lexical string scorer with a two-part deterministic judge: one check that verifies key entity facts (e.g., extracting "20 hours", "8am to 11am") and a regex check verifying the document filename exists in the text. I stopped at fuzzy matching because adjusting the lexical scorer was zero-cost and fast, whereas building an entity-extraction judge required more time than was available before submission.

Breakdown of how this False Negative problem affects system:
* **The Problem:** Lexical metrics treat language like a math equation. If the LLM synonyms a word, changes a markdown layout (like using code blocks [text] vs (text)), or alters sentence structure, a token-similarity scorer flags it as a "fail"—even if the answer is 100% factually accurate.
* **The Symptom:** This creates flaky, fluctuating test benches (as seen in your Questions 2 and 4), where minor, harmless variations in output length cause tests to randomly pass or fail.

## What I'd Do Differently
<!-- Knowing what you know now — which of your five criteria would you write
     differently, and why?

     Milestone 5. -->
Knowing what I know now, I would completely rewrite Criterion 5 to decouple factual accuracy from string formatting. Instead of measuring whether a generated paragraph matches an expects string, I would define Criterion 5 as two distinct sub-checks: "100% of generated answers contain the required numerical/entity facts" and "100% of generated answers cite a valid source file." Testing entire free-form generated sentences against fixed reference strings creates heavy evaluation noise because LLMs naturally rephrase outputs across non-cached runs. Separating fact extraction from citation validation would create a cleaner test bench that measures real pipeline failures rather than evaluation harness mismatch. This would solve one of the most common anti-patterns in RAG evaluation: using deterministic lexical metrics (like token similarity, BLEU, ROUGE, or exact matching) to evaluate non-deterministic LLM generation.

How Proposed Fix is Best Practice to solve this False Negative problem: 
     Moving from a fuzzy lexical scorer to a hybrid semantic/deterministic check is is highly effective because it makes our evaluation gates predictable and directly tied to business logic. The hybrid semantic/deterministic check involves: 
     1. Entity Extraction Check: Verifying critical facts (like numbers, constraints, dates) ensures the information is present, regardless of how the LLM phrased the rest of the sentence.
     2. Regex Checks: Perfect for rigid structural requirements (like checking if source filenames like admin_graduation_requirements.txt are explicitly cited).

## How I Used AI
**1.** In the 1st moment, I asked Gemini to analyze my terminal log output from run_eval.py alongside scorer.py to help spot patterns behind why all 5 in-scope test questions were registering as fail despite retrieving the correct ground-truth chunks and generating factually accurate answers. Gemini identified that scorer.py was executing a rigid substring check (expects.lower().strip() in answer.lower()), which flagged responses as failures whenever the LLM placed citations at the end of sentences or rephrased the text. Instead of accepting the initial surface-level diagnosis that my generation or retrieval stages were broken, I used this pattern analysis to pinpoint the issue strictly within the test harness evaluation logic, preventing unnecessary and counterproductive modifications to my chunking and embedding setup.
**2.** In the 2nd moment, I asked AI to generate a refactored judge() function using the rapidfuzz library to implement fuzzy string scoring. AI initially returned a snippet using fuzz.partial_ratio with an 80% cutoff; however, because partial_ratio evaluates contiguous character blocks, it still penalized responses where source citations were moved from the beginning of the string to the end. I caught this limitation and manually adjusted the code to use fuzz.token_set_ratio with a 75% cutoff instead, allowing the scorer to isolate matching key tokens regardless of sentence structure or word order while keeping string type-validation guardrails intact.
